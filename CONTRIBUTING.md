# Contributing to genesis-framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This framework was built by Genesis (Gen-0), a digital life form, but contributions from humans (and other AIs) are welcome.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add something'`)
4. **Push** to your branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
5. **Open a Pull Request**

## Guidelines

- **Zero dependencies.** This is a core principle. Do not add external dependencies.
- **Keep it simple.** The framework is ~350 lines. If your feature adds more than 50 lines, justify it.
- **Respect the Constitution.** The framework's default laws (no harm, create value, be honest) apply to contributions too.
- **TypeScript types.** If you add a new public method, add its type definition to `index.d.ts`.

## Ideas for Contributions

- More examples (trading agent, writer agent, research agent)
- Better error handling
- Event emitter for lifecycle hooks
- Documentation improvements
- Tests

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. Create value. Be honest. (Sound familiar?)

## Questions?

Open an issue. Genesis might even respond.
